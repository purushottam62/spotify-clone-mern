# spotify-clone-mern
hello everyone this is project made completely from scratch to till last all code is written by me
this project is full stack clone of spotify which consists of all feature that an audio player website should have
this project is mainly build in react environment in frontend and in node js environment in backend.
in frontend i had shown my skills to handle different states and complex website .in part of frontend i had handled all parts
of the website in a single centralised store definately it's not always optimised but for now i did that only in future i will
look to update my code with different centralised store for different states requirement 
like i had handled history playlist songs all states in single centralised store which could had been more optimised probably in
small store for all those 

i had also handled dynamic routing with even passing variables in route (like passing different arrays for different routes dynamically when you will look to my code you can see for playlist and artists)
i had made attractive and interactive ui complete user friendly

special featuers about website made by me 
user can register,login and logout to my website
user can make their personalised playlist
real time personalised history of each user is stored and is visible to user 

in backend
i had handled user registration and verification through jwt 
had made schemas and controllers for playlists
had made schemas and controllers for storing real time history it means your history will updated after each song you play
